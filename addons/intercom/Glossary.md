## Glossary

We are striving to make this documentation as understandable and as precise as 
possible. Therefore, we define a few terms here to, hopefully, avoid confusion.

### Contacts {#def-contacts}

If we talk about **Contacts** in this add-on, we mean collectively all Intercom 
**Users, Leads** and **Visitors** \(where applicable\). 

See the [Intercom docs](https://docs.intercom.com/faqs-and-troubleshooting/your-users-and-leads-data-in-intercom/how-do-visitors-leads-and-users-work-in-intercom) regarding details on their terminology.
