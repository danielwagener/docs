## We are adjusting pricing January 1st 2018

**22 December 2017** 

ToolsPlus is adjusting our pricing for Intercom for Jira to more accurately reflect the value users get
from the integration and to enable us to continue delivering new features and improvements.

Existing customers and evaluators will continue to benefit from our current price until March 1st 2018. The 
price change will only affect their payment schedule after March 1st.* 

Here is the new monthly pricing (USD):

**Up to 10 users**<br>
Flat rate: $10

**More than 10 users**<br>
1-100 users: $1.25/user<br>
101-250 users: $125 + $0.75/user<br>
251-2000 users: $237.50 + $0.25/user

We have come a long way since our first release in August 2017. Back then, Intercom for Jira started 
with a simple Intercom contacts display. It has now evolved to offer automatic re-opening of Intercom 
conversations, creation of issues in Intercom conversations and more! We hope these new features have 
been valuable to your workflow.

Finally, we would like to take the opportunity to thank you for your trust, support and feedback that 
has made Intercom for Jira what it is today. We look forward to continue working with you in the 
coming year. 


## Removal: *issue reporter email* contact source for Intercom Issue Panel

**12 December 2017** 

In the Intercom Issue Panel settings you are able to choose whether Intercom contacts 
should be shown based on linked conversations or the issue reporter's email. We believe 
that Intercom contacts on the Intercom Issue Panel are almost exclusively shown based on 
linked conversations (which is the default configuration for new installations). To our 
knowledge there is no use case for rendering contacts based on the issue reporter's email 
address.

### Planned change
Remove *issue reporter email* as a contact source from Intercom settings.

### How does this change affect you?
* If you are using *linked conversations* as contact source for your Intercom Issue Panel 
(this is the default) you won't be affected by this change.
* If you are using *issue reporter's email* as contact source the add-on will automatically 
fallback to linked conversations setting.

### When does this change take effect?
This change is planned to be completed by end of December or early January 2018.

Please get in touch if you are using this feature or you think removal of it might be problem 
for you.
