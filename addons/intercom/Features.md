## JIRA Issue Intercom Panel

### Match Intercom Contacts

Intercom for JIRA allows you to see [Contacts](/Glossary.md#def-contacts) \(Intercom Users and Leads\) associated with your JIRA issue or JIRA Service Desk request. Intercom for JIRA will retrieve the JIRA issue reporter's email address and try to match it against any Intercom Users or Leads with the same email address. Matching Users and Leads will automatically show up in the sidebar of your JIRA issue or Service Desk request.

### See Contact Details

The Intercom panel in the JIRA issue/JIRA Service Desk request sidebar shows Intercom Users and Leads. It is designed to see at a quick glance matching records. If you want to dive deeper and see more details click on the Details icon to show additional information for any show contact.

### Open Intercom with current Context

For any matched contact in the Intercom panel you can jump to the respective Intercom contact with just a single click. Use the external link icon to load Intercom in a new tab with the selected contact.

### Create Intercom User or Lead from Issue reporter

If Intercom for JIRA could not find a matching Intercom User or Contact you will have the option to create a User or Lead from the issue reporter.
