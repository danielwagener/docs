Link your Intercom conversations to Jira issues with [Intercom for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/io.toolsplus.atlassian.connect.jira.intercom/cloud/overview).

Intercom for Jira allows you to set up a seamless process from [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/)
conversations to Jira issue processing and back. Empower your customer service team to provide 
excellent customer communication by [linking Intercom conversations to Jira issues](ConversationLinking.md).
Updates on issues can trigger re-opening of closed Intercom conversations so your 
team knows instantly when it's time to get back to the customer.

With [conversation actions](ConversationActions.md) your Intercom team can create new Jira issues 
or link existing ones from within any Intercom conversation, without ever having to leave Intercom.

Additionally see linked Intercom conversations and their respective users right inside Jira without 
having to leave the current context. And if your workflow requires you to change systems, Intercom 
is just one click away.
