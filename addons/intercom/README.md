# Intercom for Jira

Have your Intercom data at your fingertips with [Intercom for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/io.toolsplus.atlassian.connect.jira.intercom/cloud/overview).

Intercom for Jira allows you to seamlessly integrate [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/)
into your Jira issue processing. Empower your customer service team to provide 
excellent customer communication by linking Jira issues to Intercom conversations.
Updates on issues can trigger re-opening of closed Intercom conversations so your 
team knows instantly when it's time to get back to the customer.

Additionally have Customers associated with Intercom Conversations right inside 
of Jira or Jira Service Desk without having to leave the current context. And if 
your workflow requires you to change systems, Intercom is just one click away.
