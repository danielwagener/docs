# Intercom for Jira

Link your Intercom conversations to Jira issues with [Intercom for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/io.toolsplus.atlassian.connect.jira.intercom/cloud/overview).

Intercom for Jira allows you to set up a seamless process from [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/)
conversations to Jira issue processing and back. Empower your customer service team to provide 
excellent customer communication by [linking Jira issues to Intercom conversations](ConversationLinking.md).
Updates on issues can trigger re-opening of closed Intercom conversations so your 
team knows instantly when it's time to get back to the customer.

With [conversation actions](ConversationActions.md) your Intercom team can create new Jira issues 
or link existing ones from within any Intercom conversation, without ever having to leave Intercom.

Additionally see Customers associated with Intercom Conversations right inside Jira or 
Jira Service Desk without having to leave the current context. And if 
your workflow requires you to change systems, Intercom is just one click away.
