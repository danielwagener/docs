## Contact Matching

As soon as the issue page loads, Intercom for JIRA will try to match the issue
reporter's email address against any Intercom User or Lead email addresses.
 
* If there is only _one match_ you will see the Intercom user directly showing on
  the Intercom panel.

* If there is _more then one match_ a list of Users and Leads will be shown with
  a button to see each [Contact's](Glossary.md#def-contacts) details.
  
### Open Intercom with current Context

For any matched contact in the Intercom panel you can jump to the respective 
Intercom contact with a single click. Use the link button to load Intercom in a 
new tab.

### Create Intercom User or Lead from Issue reporter

If Intercom for JIRA could not find a matching Intercom User or Contact you will 
be given the option to create a User or Lead from the issue reporter.

Simply click **Create** and select **User** or **Lead** depending on which one 
you would like to create. As soon as creation is complete the Intercom panel
reloads and the created contact is shown.
